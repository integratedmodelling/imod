/**
 * "Literate programming" features: comments introduced with the double asterisk are collected to provide
 * AsciiDoc documentation, and the concepts that follow them are documented in the processed document. If the
 * namespace is not introduced by a literate section, it won't be documented at all. 
 * 
 * @Section headers are turned into #/## etc., using intelligent nesting depending on the context (so they can start at
 * one @ unless a subsection of the previous at the same level is wanted). All the remaining text in the comment is 
 * standard Markdown or AsciiDoc, added verbatim except for a possible leading asterisk that is always stripped (along with
 * the first space after it, if present).
 * 
 * In the text, the prefix @ is used to expand the next word intelligently - for example adding a cross-reference when
 * it's the recognizable and unambiguous URN of any k.LAB asset. In case it isn't understood, the preprocessor will
 * print a warning and insert the word without the @, unless it's escaped with another @.
 * 
 * k.IM code prefixed by literate sections is inserted in the document where it belongs, with syntax highlighting and line numbering
 * dependent on processing options.
 * 
 * Re: @imod (must become the intro here):
 * 
 * The epistemological framework for @im is systems thinking. The domain structure defines how that is articulated within the
 * worldview. The domains are contextualized to explicit systems, introduced in general here. TODO should be compared quickly
 * with other possible choices: e.g. rationalism, realism (BFO), pragmatism, empiricism, constructivism.
 * 
 * Each domain is a perspective on a system. The two main perspectives are the ontological (Physical domain) and the epistemological
 * (Knowledge domain). The systems are explicit in this worldview, expressed as Configurations ("perceived" systems). The physical
 * domain pertaining to a system is one and one only. The knowledge domains may be multiple, according to what the knowledge
 * described in each domain emphasizes (e.g. @economics, @sociology and @policy for the @society domain). Of course the 
 * ontological domains are _also_ knowledge - but from within the worldview, they are assumed to represent the ontological
 * reality of the observed world and are assumed complete and internally consistent, while there is no such requirement for individual knowledge
 * domains. 
 * 
 * Tier 1 ontologies *must* declare their domain, which locates them within a system and a perspective on it. Tier 2 domains
 * *must not* declare the domain, as they inherit them from the corresponding Tier 1 ontology, which must exist. This project
 * contains only Tier 1 ontologies, which have a single name as namespace without dot separators.
 * 
 * E.g., a definition for the @agency space: Systems thinking provides a framework for understanding the complexity of decision processes and their 
 * consequences within a holistic context. It emphasizes the interconnections between parts of a system and how those parts 
 * influence one another. Within this framework, a decision process is seen as part of a larger system of actions and 
 * feedback loops, with consequences understood in terms of their impact on the system as a whole. 
 * 
 * Also this (and the Physical domains) is a good place to discuss what @im is not covering and why.

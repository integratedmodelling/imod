* IMOD - Integrated Modelling Observables and Descriptions

This project is an incubator Tier 1 worldview for the development of the first production-level k.IM worldview, meant to substitute the _im_ worldview used in most applications, and to serve as a basis for Tier 2 worldviews developed with communities.

This effort is led by Ferdinando Villa and Greta Adamo for the k.LAB team.
